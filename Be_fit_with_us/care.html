                        We are currently working on enabling multiple orders from the same address (for the same person or different).  Till then, you can request the phlebotomist who comes for the sample collection for the first order, to add on the rest of the tests (for the same person or different).  You can directly pay him via card / UPI / cash for the additional tests purchased.

            <h4>Lab tests At home</h4>
            <p>Lab tests are essential not just to help the doctor detect a condition or a disease, but are also important to plan the treatment, monitor its efficacy, and switch it if it is not helping you the way it should. They may be advised by the doctor to detect certain specific conditions or as a part of a routine checkup. Until a few years ago, getting lab tests to check the samples of our blood, tissue, or urine to get a diagnosis of diseases or other conditions used to be done at hospitals or clinics. This used to have its own share of stress, costs, and other concerns. However, due to several innovations in diagnostic healthcare, things like telemedicine and home diagnostic tests are a reality. Home testing services have been possible due to the advancements in laboratory technology, growth and penetration of the internet, the birth of inventive health-tech startups, and the fact that people are becoming more cognizant of their health and ordering these tests and health checkup at home. Not only are these lab tests at home simple, systematic, have a quick turnaround time, but also 100 percent accurate. Depending on the service that you choose, home diagnostic tests can be done at ourselves at home or by experienced phlebotomists who come to collect the samples at home.</p>

            <h4>How does at-home lab test work?</h4>
            <p>Home lab tests are a swift and easy way to take control of your health. This is how they work: Keeping in mind the test advised by your doctor, select ‘lab test near me’, make the payment, and schedule the appointment. On the scheduled day and time, a phlebotomist will visit your location to collect your samples. After the completion of your lab test, your reports will be reviewed by experienced and independent physicians or by doctors in our panel of hospitals. Your reports with the diagnosis will be available on the app and will be emailed to you within 24 hours of the sample collection.</p>

            <h4>What types of diagnostic tests are available?</h4>
            <p>At Be.fit, we offer close to 20 diagnostic tests that cover every aspect of your health. These tests include pathology tests, which involve the collection of blood and urine samples and screening tests.
